# Math-330: Wi-Fi Performance Comparison between Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall 

Full paper can be found [here](https://github.com/MoRevolution/330-Hypothesis-Testing/blob/main/Project-Notebook.pdf). 

This project investigates potential differences in Wi-Fi performance between Hanson Hall of Science and Old Main Hall on the Augustana College (IL) campus. These buildings represent the sciences and humanities departments, respectively.
Objective

The main goal of this project is to conduct a statistical hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference in Wi-Fi performance between the two buildings, which could point to potential infrastructure inequality.

### Methodology

Data was collected over the course of one week, focusing on key Wi-Fi performance metrics such as:

    Download speed
    Upload speed
    Signal strength
    Latency
    Network stability

Measurements were taken at specific locations within each building to ensure consistent and comparable results.
